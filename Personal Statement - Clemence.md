**Personal Contribution**

In this project, we worked mostly together, however, I predominantly focused on identifying the location of the license plate in the image, generalising the code to operate with different images and attempted other methods of character recognition. To make these sections, I predominantly used the methods learned during the lectures, elaborating each step through trial and error.

**Reflection**

I have gained valuable insights into the difficulties regarding image processing in real world scenarios, and the importance of positioning the camera prior to the picture in order to simplify consequent image processing.
I have also gained an understanding about the order in which image processing should be done, in order to obtain ideal results, as well as the quantity of image processing that usually goes on in the background, unbeknownst to the user. 
When doing research about this project, I was also confronted with incomplete and prone to error examples, and learned to evaluate these rapidly in order to avoid wasting time pursing a wrong direction.

Overall I mostly learned about the reality of image processing in real-world scenarios, and I was amazed at what could be achieved!
